# flutterclient

A Websocket client to talk to the Springboot server.

## Getting Started

Start the springboot app.  You can open this in vscode (have Jave 14 installed and the java and spring extensions)

If you want you can also connect to the Websocket echo server as I did in the Dart client package.   This connects to the html5rocks echo service.   I did this to make sure 'something' worked.

There are errors in the integration_test package.  Just disregard these when running the app.
